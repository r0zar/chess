# Real-time Chess Game Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** based real-time functionality to the chess game, providing instant updates for:

- âœ… **Live move updates** - Opponent moves appear instantly
- âœ… **Player join/leave notifications** - Real-time player status
- âœ… **Game state synchronization** - Automatic state sync without manual refresh
- âœ… **Connection status indicators** - Visual connection health feedback
- âœ… **Graceful reconnection** - Automatic reconnect with exponential backoff

## Architecture

### 1. Server-Side Components

#### `/lib/game-events.ts`
- **GameEventBroadcaster** class manages SSE connections
- In-memory connection management for real-time events
- Automatic connection cleanup and heartbeat monitoring
- Event broadcasting with user exclusion support

#### `/app/api/game/[gameId]/events/route.ts`
- SSE endpoint using Next.js Edge Runtime
- Vercel-optimized for global performance
- Automatic game validation and initial state delivery
- Proper SSE headers with compression disabled

#### Enhanced API Routes
- **Move API** (`/api/game/[gameId]/move/route.ts`) - Broadcasts moves to all connected clients
- **Identify API** (`/api/game/[gameId]/identify/route.ts`) - Broadcasts player join events

### 2. Client-Side Components

#### `/hooks/useGameEvents.ts`
- React hook for SSE connection management
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Connection state tracking and error handling
- Event parsing and type safety

#### Enhanced Game Board Client
- Real-time move processing without page refresh
- Toast notifications for opponent actions
- Visual connection status indicator
- Optimistic UI updates with server validation

## Event Types

```typescript
type GameEvent = 
  | { type: 'move'; data: { move: Move; gameState: GameState; playerId: string } }
  | { type: 'player_joined'; data: { playerColor: PlayerColor; playerId: string } }
  | { type: 'player_disconnected'; data: { playerColor: PlayerColor; playerId: string } }
  | { type: 'game_ended'; data: { winner?: PlayerColor; reason: string; status: GameStatus } }
  | { type: 'sync_required'; data: { reason: string } }
  | { type: 'heartbeat'; data: { timestamp: number } }
```

## Key Features

### Real-time Move Updates
- Moves broadcast instantly to opponent
- Visual notifications with move notation (e.g., "Nf3")
- Automatic board state synchronization
- Selection state cleared on opponent moves

### Connection Management
- Visual connection indicator (green = live, red = offline)
- Automatic reconnection on network issues
- Exponential backoff prevents server overload
- Graceful degradation when SSE unavailable

### Player Management
- Live player join/leave notifications
- Real-time player count updates
- Address/wallet connection status

### Game State Sync
- Automatic state synchronization on events
- Fallback to manual refresh if needed
- Conflict resolution with server state

## Usage

### Starting a Real-time Game

1. Navigate to `/play/[gameId]` 
2. Connection automatically established
3. Green "Live" indicator shows active connection
4. Moves appear instantly without refresh

### Connection States

- **ðŸŸ¢ Live** - Real-time connection active
- **ðŸ”´ Offline** - Connection lost, attempting reconnect
- **Reconnecting** - Automatic reconnection in progress

## Technical Details

### Vercel Deployment
- Uses Edge Runtime for global SSE performance
- Automatic scaling and connection management
- No additional infrastructure required

### Memory Management
- Connections automatically cleaned up on disconnect
- Heartbeat prevents zombie connections
- Efficient in-memory event broadcasting

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback to polling if SSE fails
- Comprehensive error logging and recovery
- User-friendly error notifications

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Open same game in two browser windows
2. Make moves in one window
3. Observe instant updates in other window
4. Check connection indicator status
5. Test reconnection by toggling network

### Connection Verification
```bash
# Check SSE endpoint (should stay connected)
curl -N http://localhost:3000/api/game/[gameId]/events

# Monitor connection logs in browser developer tools
```

## Performance

- **Latency**: Sub-second move propagation
- **Scalability**: Supports multiple concurrent games
- **Bandwidth**: Minimal overhead with event-based updates
- **Memory**: Efficient connection management

## Future Enhancements

- ðŸ”„ **Move animation synchronization**
- ðŸ‘¥ **Live spectator count**
- ðŸ’¬ **Real-time chat during games**
- ðŸ“Š **Connection quality indicators**
- ðŸ’¾ **Offline mode with move queuing**
